* Difference between final , finally and finallize

1) final

> Access modifier.
-> used with 
	class -> we cant create extends that class with child class. 			Inheritance is not possible.
 	Method -> We cant override that Method.
	Variable -> We cant change value of variable.
	

2) finally
-> it is a block associated with try-catch.
-> we have to write clean up code(Resource deallocation) inside finally block.
-> It only close Resources that are open within try block only. 
-> Speciality of finally block is it is always excuted whether Excepton is occurs or not.
-> it meant for try block opened activities.

3) Finalize
-> it is a method.
-> it is associated with garbage collector.
-> if any object is not having any reference variable then it is always eligible for garbage collection.
-> to perform clean up activity garbage collector called finalize method just before destroying an object.  
-> It will close resources associated with object that are going to destroy. that type of clean up done in finalize.
it is meant for object related clean up activites.
