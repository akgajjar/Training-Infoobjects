* Exception Handlingfinally block vs System. exit (0)

-> System.exit(0) will shutdown jvm so in this situation finally block wont be executed. this is only 1 situation when finally block wont be executed
EX : 
try{

   System.out.println("try");
   System.exit(0);
   }
  catch(Exception e)
  {
   System.out.println("catch");
  }
  finally{
   System.out.println("finally");
  }


-> number we passed in system.exit is status code. 0 means normal termination and non-zero value means abnormal termination. Programatically it is always same . Program is terminated but it is used by jvm for logs.
