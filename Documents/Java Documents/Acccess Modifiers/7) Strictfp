* Strictfp keyword in java

-> strictfp is a keyword in java used for restricting floating-point calculations and ensuring same result on every platform while performing operations in the floating-point variable.
-> Floating point calculations are platform dependent i.e. different output(floating-point values) is achieved when a class file is run on different platforms(16/32/64 bit processors). To solve this types of issue, strictfp keyword was introduced in JDK 1.2 version by following IEEE 754 standards for floating-point calculations.

* Important points:
->strictfp modifier is used with classes, interfaces and methods only.


Ex:

strictfp class Test
{   
    // all concrete methods here are
    // implicitly strictfp.    
}
strictfp interface Test
{   
    // all  methods here becomes implicitly 
    // strictfp when used during inheritance.    
}
class Car
{  
    // strictfp applied on a concrete method 
    strictfp void calculateSpeed(){}
}  
        
-> When a class or an interface is declared with strictfp modifier, then all methods declared in the class/interface, and all nested types declared in the class, are implicitly strictfp.
-> strictfp cannot be used with abstract methods. However, it can be used with abstract classes/interfaces.
-> Since methods of an interface are implicitly abstract, strictfp cannot be used with any method inside an interface.

	strictfp interface Test 
	{
    		double sum();
    		strictfp double mul(); // compile-time error here
	}

Ex :

//Java program to illustrate strictfp modifier 
  
public class Test 
{ 
    // calculating sum using strictfp modifier 
    public strictfp double sum() 
    { 
        double num1 = 10e+10; 
  
        double num2 = 6e+08; 
  
        return (num1+num2); 
  
    } 
  
    public static strictfp void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        Test t = new Test(); 
  
        System.out.println(t.sum()); 
    } 
} 
Output:

	1.006E11
