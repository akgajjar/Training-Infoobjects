* Access Specifiers vs Access Modifiers
-> In old languages like c++ public private Protected , default are considered as access specifiers. except this remaining(like static) are considered as access modifiers.

-> but in java there is no terminology like specifiers. all are by default considered as modifiers only

	public 		synchronized
	private		abstract
	protected	native
	default		Strictfp
	final		transient
	static		volatile

--> only allowed modifiers for outer class public, default, final, abstract, Strictfp only

--> with local variable only final is possible.
