* Collection and Generics

->	collection -> topic, Group of something
	Collection -> Interface 
	Collections-> Class


 int a[] = new int[4];
-> Size is Fixed . we can not expand size.
-> to overcome this issue we have collection.

 Collection values = new ArrayList();
 values.add(5);
 values.add(6);

-> if you know size is fixed use array not collection because array is faster.

-> By default collection's value type is Object. we can add any value into collection.

* Generics

-> main purpose of generics is to provide type safety and to resolve type casting problems.
