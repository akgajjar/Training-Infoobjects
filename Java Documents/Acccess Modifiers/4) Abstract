* Abstract
-> used with classes and methods.
 
* Abstract class in Java
-> A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
-> It needs to be extended and its method implemented. 
-> It cannot be instantiated.

* Points to Remember about abstract class
-> An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
-> It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
-> It cannot be instantiated.
-> It can have constructors and static methods also.
-> It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

* Example of abstract class

	abstract class A{}  

* Abstract Method in Java

-> A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.

* Example of abstract method

	abstract void printStatus();//no method body and abstract  

-> we can not have abstract method in non abstract class. we have to make class abstract.
